# Pitch League App

I am making our pitch-league project, whose backend I wrote in Golang, into an app with flutter.

## The necessary codes are in the lib folder

I hope to continue the project. It is not fully completed yet. 

What to do:
- Users will be able to create teams (only admin can do it for now)
- Users will be able to create matches (only admin can do it for now)
- Users will have a certain scoring system with rating in their profile (statistics etc.)
- Interaction between users can be established (chat screen full-time communication with websocket)
- Users will be able to invite footballers to the team
